# Bibliography

A lot of different ideas feed into Defenders of Kathrakopolis,
but these are the major sources I've worked with.
This list includes things that inspired me when writing the campaign itself,
even if they don't show up in this player's guide.

**Players Please Note**: beware of spoilers! Knowing all the references might tell you more than you want to know about the plot of the game.

These aren't academic references, nor recommendations.
I'm not writing a bibliography to claim that these people are right, or that they prove I know what I'm talking about; I just want to acknowledge the real work done by other people that allowed me to make this thing for my game.

## Acknowledgements

I'm indebted to the other players I've had the opportunity to discuss my ideas on this with: ohokwy, the Trollslayers, and the Space Cadets.
