WIP Pathfinder tweaks for a superhero-themed game

## House Rules

I'm using a couple of house rules to produce a superhero
aethetic with the mechanics of Pathfinder.

### Limited Spell Selection

### Magic Items as Powers 

Rather than purchasing magic items to enhance their
abilities, characters will improve their innate
superpowers as they become familiar with their powers.

There will be no magic items that give permanent bonuses
in loot or for sale. Instead, PCs will each recieve a number
of "power points", which can be spent to purchase innate
encancement bonuses at the same rate as standard items.
For instance, a +2 Strength bonus is 4,000 PP, exactly
as if you spent 4,000 gp on a Belt of Giant Strength.

You don't have to spend PP on enchancement bonuses,
or even neccessarily magic items.
You could buy a "hammerspace" power based on the Handy
Haversack, a ranged attack based on a +1 Flaming Longbow,
or the DR and AC of adamantine full plate. With GM
permission, you could build a custom power as a custom
magic item.

However, a power also comes with most of the disadvantages of
the base item. That firey attack requires two hands,
and must be visibly active (say, as a halo of flames)
before you can use it.

The adamantine DR slows you down like physical heavy armour,
and is clearly visible -- as gleaming metal skin, or
maybe a shimmering forcefield -- unless you have a way to
hide it (perhaps by spending PP on the _glamered_ quality).
