# Defenders of Kathrakopolis

WIP 3.PF tweaks for a superhero-themed game

## Setting Notes

Adventurers as we typically understand them do not yet exist,
nor do superheroes (yet); the PCs will be the first of their kind.

Kathrakopolis is a bustling, world-leading city, where the
state of the art is practiced in every art -- but the state
of the art in arcane magic is enourmous rune-covered monoliths that
bring slow, subtle blessings to the city (and look like
skyscrapers).

About 65% of the citizens are human, 15% Strix,
10% giants (mostly ogres, cyclopes, and the homebrew "mirror giants"),
and 10% half-humans (Aasimar, Ifrits, Fetchlings, etc.).

## General character creation

So we have enough levels to build proper supers, the game will start with 8th-level characters.

For fluff reasons, players are encouraged to build Strix, Ogre,
half-human or human characters (rather than elves, dwarves, etc).

Except for a few egregriously broken things (chained Summoner, etc.),
there are no hard race or class restrictions.
However, spellcasters are heavily nerfed -- check the house rules below
before building one.

### Religion

While the familiar deities of Golarion don't exist here in any
recognisable form, most residents of Kathrakopolis honour the gods
of the Ring of Twelve:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Title</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Areas of Concern</th><th>Domains</th><th>Favoured Weapon</th><th>Holy Symbol</th><th>Other Symbols</th><th>Colours</th></tr>

<tr><th>Helta</th><td>The Armed</td><td>N</td><td>Soldiers, atheletes, colonisation</td><td>Strength, Glory, War</td><td>Javelin</td><td>Laurel Wreath</td><td>Dogs, discus</td><td>Red and Gold</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Although not part of the Ring of Twelve, a few other gods are also widely worshipped:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Title</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Areas of Concern</th><th>Domains</th><th>Favoured Weapon</th><th>Holy Symbol</th><th>Other Symbols</th><th>Colours</th></tr>
</thead>

<tr><th>Gat</th><td>The Last</td><td>N</td><td>Endings, accepting fate, martyrdom</td><td>Repose, Darkness, Madness</td><td>Sap</td><td>Hemlock</td><td>Black flame, salmon</td><td>Black</td></tr>
<tr><th>Asham</th><td>The Unseen</td><td>N</td><td>Prophecy, funerals, turning points</td><td>Repose, Knowledge, Death</td><td>Butterfly Swords</td><td>Blindfold</td><td>Musrooms, spiders</td><td>Turquoise</td></tr>
<tr><th>Nam-Tarrag</th><td>The Impending</td><td>CN</td><td>Monsters, disasters, limits</td><td>Animal, Weather, Fire, Destruction</td><td>Warhammer</td><td>Domino</td><td>Banksia, lightning bolt</td><td>Orange, black</td></tr>
<tr><th>Ulalla</th><td>The Chorus</td><td>CN</td><td>Wild places, wild parties, wine</td><td>Charm, Animals, Strenght, Liberation</td><td>Falchion</td><td>Amphora</td><td>Wolf, pine</td><td>Blue and Maroon</td></tr>
<tr><th>Oecon</th><td>The Centre</td><td>LN</td><td>Harvest, cooking, home</td><td>Plant, Community, Earth, Healing</td><td>Flail</td><td>Cornucopia</td><td>Ants, fireplaces</td><td>Brown and Yellow</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Kathrakopolis also hosts a wide variety of mystery
cults, so feel free to make up a deity if you want.

Furthermore, I'm blanket allowing clerics of abstract ideals; they can take
whatever domains, favoured weapons, etc. suit the concept.
(Although I do reserve the right to reject alignmment-incompatible
combinations, or things that turn out to be hugely broken.)
Deity-specific feats, traits, etc. are more of a problem;
talk to me if you want to take one of those.

## House Rules

I'm using a couple of house rules to produce a superhero
aesthetic with the mechanics of PF:

### Limited Spell Selection

The existing spell lists are a rich source of ways to represent powers.
For instance, a earth-controlling hero might use
the Shape Earth spell to represent their powers.

But what will you do with your other spell slots?
An optimal build would use a variety of different spells,
muddying the original concept and running the risk of
overshadowing non-caster-based PCs.
Especially at the high levels suitable for superheroes,
casters overshadowing martials is a serious concern.

#### Base Spells Known: 1 per 2 levels

To mitigate this, I'm heavily restricting spell lists:
All casters have a base "spells known" allowance of one spell per two levels,
which typically means only 1-2 spells of each level they can cast.
(But full casters get bonus spells as well; see below)

For **spontaneous casters**, this just means fewer spells known:
an 8th-level bard would know 4 spells, each at most 3rd level.

**Divine prepared casters** now have a "spells known" list just like
sorcerors and bards do. These spells are chosen from the full list
they would normally have access to.
This means an 8th-level ranger might know Wind Wall, Longstrider, Jump, and Read Magic,
but not Bless (which isn't on the Ranger spell list).

Like spontaneous spellcasters, divine casters can adjust their spells known
as they level up. Full (9-level) casters swap out spells on even levels,
and partial casters on odd levels.
(I assume 8th level is high enough that all spellcasters have qualified for this.)

This doesn't make them spontaneous casters;
they must still choose and prepare spells in advance.

Divine casters _may_ be able to beseech their god or guiding principle
for a spell they can't cast themselves.
With the right ritual, sacrifice, and/or quest, it might even work.
In other words, they can "trade for" spellcasting services
despite this setting lacking consulting spellcasters.

**Arcane "book" casters**, like wizards, alchemists, and magi,
get slightly more flexibility: they can use all spells of
a single arcane school (chosen at character creation).
But they're still restricted by what's in their spellbook,
and _that's_ subject to the "spells known" limit.

For example, an 8th-level alchemist would get 4 "free"
extracts in their formula book, rather than the standard 9.

Book casters can still purchase and copy spells as normal,
but finding spells to copy or casters to learn from is
not guaranteed.

#### Full Casters and Bonus Spells

Not all heroes have a power for every situation --
but there are a few who are defined by good preparation.

If you're playing a full caster who gets bonus spells per day,
you have a wider spell selection. Casters with bonus spells get
a bonus spell known/spellbook entry at every odd
level (so they get a spell per level instead of 1 / two levels).

Again, **spontaneous casters** are straightforward: their bonus spells
are the listed ones for their bloodline (or mystery, discipline, etc.).

Likewise, **druids with domains** get their listed domain spells
as bonus spells known. (Druids who take animal companions instead
are assumed to be focussing their efforts their efforts there,
and only get the base one spell per two levels).

**Clerics** have to pick and chose which domain spells to know.
An 8th-level cleric would only have access to four of their
normal 8 domain spells.

Alternatively, a cleric can miss out on a domain
spell and take an extra spell from the normal cleric list instead
(possibly meaning they can't use the domain slot).

**Wizards**, being uniquely versatile, can pick any spell from their
chosen school as a bonus spell.

**Universalist wizards** are wholly about versatility, so they get
two special exceptions:

* A universalist wizard can pick two arcane schools instead of one.
* Universalists get a new spellbook spell at every level,
  from either of their chosen schools, despite lacking bonus spell slots.

**All these rules** modify bonus spells, not the property of being a full caster.
If a partial caster has bonus spells, they can take one as a spell known
each odd level, until all the bonus spells are on their list.

#### Special Bonus Spells

Many full casters get free spells known that are inherent to the
nature of the class. The ones I'm aware of are:

* Read Magic for wizards,
* Spontaneous cure/inflict spells for clerics,
* Summon Nature's Ally for druids, and
* Detect Thoughts and Telepathic Bond for psychics.

These class features are over and above the spells known defined above,
and don't count towards the other limits.

So an 8th-level cleric gets a total of 12 spells known:

* 4 cleric spells,
* 4 domain spells, and
* Cure (or Inflict) Light, Moderate, Serious, and Critical wounds.

#### Other weird cases / extra rules

* This doesn't let spontaneous casters learn more high-level spells.
  An 8th-level bard will know four spells, but at most one can be 3rd
  level, and at most three 2nd level. To known more than that,
  they'd have to have learned spells before they could cast them.
 
* On the other hand, a new spell known doesn't _have_ to be the highest-level
  one you can cast. That 8th-level bard could know four first-level spells
  if they wanted; they'll just have trouble using their 2nd- and 3rd-level slots.
  (Metamagic feats, and just preparing spells in over-leveled slots, can help here.)

* You only need to learn a given spell once per class. A cleric with the Healing
  domain doesn't need to take Cure Light Wounds as a domain spell known, because they
  already have it from spontaneous casting.
  Similarly, a 4th-level druid with the Fire domain can cast Produce Flame as a 1st-level
  druid spell because they know it from the domain.

* None of this affects your _spell list_, for the purpose of things like UMD checks and
  using scrolls. Furthermore, book casters can still copy out-of-school spells into their spellbooks
  for crafting, even though they can never cast them, and divine casters can still count
  any spells on their full spell list towards crafting pre-requisites.
  
* Items like the Ring and Page of Spell Knowlege can be used to exceed these limits.
  These can also be bought as powers with Stars (see next section).

### Magic Items as Powers 

Rather than purchasing magic items to enhance their
abilities, characters will improve their innate
superpowers as they become familiar with them.

There will be no magic items that give permanent bonuses
in loot or for sale. Instead, PCs each recieve a number
of "stars", which can be spent to purchase innate
encancement bonuses at the same rate as standard items.
For instance, a +2 Strength bonus is 4,000 ✪, exactly
as if you spent 4,000 gp on a Belt of Giant Strength.

Most encounters will give ✪ rather than GP loot.
These can be converted into GP if necessary (wealth is a power!),
but not necessarily the other way.

You don't have to spend ✪ on enchancement bonuses,
or even neccessarily magic items.
You could buy a "hammerspace" power based on the Handy
Haversack, a ranged attack based on a +1 Flaming Longbow,
or the DR and AC of adamantine full plate. With GM
permission, you could build a custom power as a custom
magic item.

However, a power also comes with most of the disadvantages of
the base item. That firey attack requires two hands,
and must be visibly active (say, as a halo of flames)
before you can use it.

The adamantine DR slows you down like physical heavy armour,
and is clearly visible -- as gleaming metal skin, or
maybe a shimmering forcefield -- unless you have a way to
hide it (perhaps by spending ✪ on the _glamered_ quality).
