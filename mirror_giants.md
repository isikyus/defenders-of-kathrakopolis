# Mirror Giant

The Mirror Giants of Kathrakopolis are considered the most "civilised" of giants.
While hedonistic Ogres and proud Cyclopes are found throughout the northern mountains,
the Mirror Giants congregate in Kathrakopolis itself, and in nearby industrial towns such as
Monument and Furnace.

The Mirror Giants consider themselves the favoured children of Telatek, god of invention,
and many dedicate their lives to intricate crafts, or seek insight into the complexities of the world,
becoming lawyers, engineers, or arcanists (working with rune-pillars).

While most are content with peaceful lives, a few Mirror Giants are prepared to fight;
here, they turn their natural insight into an uncanny ability to strike accurately when it matters.

## Physical Description

A Mirror Giant's most noticeable feature is their silver skin, which they usually keep polished
to a mirror sheen. Many shave their hair completely off; others wear it in short red or white
cuts, or neatly braided out of the way.

Mirror Giants are shorter than many other giants.
They typically stand 8-10 feet tall, and weigh from 800 to 1,100 pounds.
